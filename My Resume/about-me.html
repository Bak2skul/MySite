    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello world.<br>
        I'm a born and raised New Yorker. I love NY, but after 
        having the privilege of traveling to 20 other countries accross 5 continents, 
        I still have 174 countries to go, untill I can truly say "Hello world". <br>
        Other than programing, and real estate, I'm a connoisseur pizza, I'll never say "no" to a musical 
        or comedy show, and I'm incredibly lucky and greatful for my friends and family. 
        One of my non-professional goals for 2024, is for my command of 
        the Spanish language to be at the B1 level on the <a href="https://evalground.com/blog/cefr-levels-top-language-proficiency-tests/">CEFR</a> 
        scale.
